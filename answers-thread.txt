1. a) Two threads putting the same key at the same time could both see that the key is not already present, and both insert a new entry.
      This will lead to two entries with the same key.
   b) Two threads inserting to the same bucket at the same time could pass the same `n` argument to `insert`.
      This will lead to the first thread's entry to be 'forgotten'.
      Also, if we later add code to de-allocate the entries, it will miss the first thread's entry.
